## ðŸ§© Project Summary
The Corner Grocer project was designed to solve the problem of efficiently tracking and analyzing grocery store inventory data. The program reads a list of items purchased from a text file and produces a report showing how many times each item appears. It also allows users to search for specific items and outputs a histogram displaying the purchase frequency of all items.  

This project demonstrates core C++ concepts such as file input/output, loops, data structures (maps), modular function design, and user interaction through console menus. It also shows my ability to write clean, well-documented, and readable code that follows software development best practices.

## ðŸŒŸ What I Did Well
I organized the program into multiple reusable functions and maintained a clear, modular structure. Each part of the program has a single responsibility, which made it easier to debug and maintain. Meaningful variable names, consistent indentation, and in-line comments make the code professional and easy to understand.

## ðŸ”§ Areas for Enhancement
Future improvements could include better error handling for invalid inputs, missing files, or incorrect item names. Implementing exception handling and data validation would make the program more secure and reliable. Additionally, adding a graphical interface or web-based dashboard could make data visualization more user-friendly and scalable.

## ðŸ’¡ Challenges and How I Overcame Them
The biggest challenge was correctly using C++ maps to count and store item frequencies. Initially, logic errors caused incorrect counts. I overcame this by breaking the problem into smaller parts, testing each function individually, and using debugging tools in Visual Studio. Reviewing official C++ documentation and online resources like Stack Overflow helped me improve my understanding.  

Through this process, I strengthened my ability to research solutions and utilize technical communities as part of my professional support network.

## ðŸ§  Transferable Skills
This project helped me strengthen key skills valuable for future coursework and real-world programming:
- Writing modular, readable, and efficient C++ code  
- Applying object-oriented programming concepts  
- Using file handling and data structures effectively  
- Problem-solving through debugging and logical thinking  
- Following software design best practices and documentation standards  

These skills are directly transferable to other programming languages, system design, and software development projects.

## ðŸ§± Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability
The code is maintainable and adaptable by using separate functions and clear documentation. The program flow is easy to follow, and each function performs a specific, well-defined task. Descriptive naming conventions and consistent formatting enhance readability, allowing future improvementsâ€”such as adding a database connection or GUIâ€”to be implemented with minimal code rewriting.

## ðŸ›  Git Branching Workflow (Recommended)
To demonstrate professional version control practices, the repository includes the following branches:
- `main` â€” Final version ready for submission  
- `dev` â€” Development branch for ongoing work  
- `feature/<name>` â€” Branches for individual features or updates  

Included files:
- **git_branch_workflow_CS210.png** â€” Diagram of the branching workflow  
- **git_branch_commands_CS210.md** â€” Recommended Git commands and workflow  

Use these resources to manage branches, features, and merges efficiently.
